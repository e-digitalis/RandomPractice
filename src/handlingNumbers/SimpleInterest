/*#Task
Create a Java program that calculates the interest payable on a loan after n months.
This particular bank has an interest rate of 2.3% per month.
The user will enter the loan amount, and how many months he/she will be paying the loan off.
The program will then calculate the total repayment costs based on n months + the original loan amount for the specified rate of interest.
Good luck :) 


Formula #1 
I=Prn
Interest (I) = Principal (P) times Rate Per Period (r) times Number of Periods (n)
Divide an annual rate by 12 to get (r) if the Period is a month.

Formula #2 
I=Prt 
Interest (I) = Principal (P) times Annual Rate (r) times Time in Years (t)
The time can be specified as a fraction of a year (e.g. 5 months would be 5/12 years).
